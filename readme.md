# Purpose
<p>This project was intended as a gift for my brother's new born baby. Rumour had it he would be named Scott, but he ended up being named Kendrick :) </p>
<p>It is interesting what can be done on the cmd with simple logic, this project demonstrates one such logic. I believe the approach used here can be improved vastly. One of the ways to imporve this project is instead of having some predefined words for display, the user be allowed to enter custom text.</p>
