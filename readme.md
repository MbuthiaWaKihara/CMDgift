# Fun Project
exciting cmd effects using only asterisks. They later changed the baby's name to Kendrick :( smh...

<p>Feel free to improve upon this approach of cmd printing. An interesting extension to this program would be to create a feature
where users can type in standard paragraphs and print them on cmd as gifts or surprises to loved ones, another feature extension would be user 
color config, they are endless...</p>
